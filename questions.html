        <hr class="featurette-divider">




        <div class="list-group">
            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">How It Works</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text">You begin at our location at (3734 King Street East) where you park your vehicle and sign in. We shuttle you north up river with our boats, and you paddle/tube back down south to our location where you parked your vehicle.</p>


            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Where do we start?</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text">You start at our location by the Freeport Bridge, at 3734 King Street East, Kitchener Ontario.</p>


            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Where do we finish?</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text">You paddle/tube back downstream to our location by the Freeport Bridge, at 3734 King Street East, where you began your trip and you enter your vehicle and take off.</p>


            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Where do we park?</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text">We have parking on site at our location, free of charge while you are on the Grand using our service.</p>



            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">When are our trip times?</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text">
                Our shuttles run on the hour in the mornings at 08:00 AM, 09:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 12:00 PM and on the half hour in the afternoon
                at 1:30 PM, 02:30 PM, 03:30 PM and 04:30 PM
            </p>



            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">How long do we have?</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text">
                No matter what time you go out at, you just have to be back by 06:00 PM, the cost of the trip remains the same. We recommend
                those going out to fish or those that would like to picnic for a long time to go out on earlier trips to have the entire day on the Grand.
            </p>



            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Which trip do you recommend?</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text">
                We recommend the Breslau trip for all first time paddlers, as it is a fairly easy paddle and gives you sometime to experience
                and take in the Grand River
            </p>



            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Do you provide equipment?</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text">Yes we provide paddles, life jackets and a safety kit along with your boat .</p>



            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Do you need experience?</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text">
                You do not need experience, the Grand River is a fairly easy paddle and we provide instructions on how to paddle it
                when you arrive at your drop off destination.
            </p>


            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">How long does tubing take?</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text">
                Tubing is only offered from Otterbein at noon and takes approximately four hours to complete as you go with
                the flow of the current.
            </p>


            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Do we need to book online?</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text">
                You do not need to book online, however we highly recommend it to have your spot reserved for you
                in the event that we are booked up we will take those with reservations first, however we do accept walk-ins.
            </p>



            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">What type of boats do you have?</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text">We have canoes, kayaks, tandem kayaks and tubes at Canoe the Grand.</p>



            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Can we bring our own canoes or kayaks?</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text">
                Yes you may, however you will only save $20.00, it is not recommended that you bring
                your own boat as our boats are designed to take a beating from the rocks on the Grand and personal boats tend to be less dense.
            </p>



            <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">How many people fit in a canoe?</h4>
            <p class="list-group-item-text">
                It is recommended that you go two to a canoe as the Grand River is fairly shallow and too much weight can
                cause you to hit the bottom more often, but you can fit two adults and two small children at max.
            </p>
